# Motivating Hydra

Series of Python files motivating a "maturity model" for configuration usage,
with a view towards using Facebook Research's **Hydra** library.

The files loosely imitate the
[existing tidbit](../..//2020/2020-12-18_hydra-pl/train.py), which uses Hydra
together with PyTorch Lightning for distributed training.

To get started, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and start reading
the files in order.
